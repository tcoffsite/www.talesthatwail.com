            Long story short, Make It Real has proven a little too on the edge
            for the publisher that accepted it. As written elsewhere on this
            site, the series takes an unadulterated look at life in the 80s,
            specifically what it was like to be young in the 80s. That decade
            was more or less the culmination of the 50s, 60s, and 70s all rolled
            into one; Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's and the Fourth of July
            combined.

            Yes, there were good times. <b>Great</b> times. And also dark times.
            Moreover, there are no apologies made for what went on and there is
            no altering history so said history tastes better to the modern-day
            palate. You'll find no bullshit or political correctness.

            Due to disappointment with the aforementioned publisher, Mr. Bender
            has opted to publish independently. He appreciates your help in
            hiring a professional editor and professional cover artist. Not that
            he's asking you to foot the bill. No, he's putting a lot into the
            kitty as well. If you're of a mind, please contribute by visiting:
